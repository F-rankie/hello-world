hello-world
===========

To support my first steps with GitHub

So this is the README.md file in my glorious, humongous hello-world project.
I am typing these lines on 20-Dec-2014.

Unfortunately I can't tell much more about this project right now.

So, this line (currently #11) is added via the editor in RStudio.
